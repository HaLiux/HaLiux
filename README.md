- 👋 Hi, I’m Henkka "HaLiux"
- 👀 I’m interested in nature, science and music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer skills and linux developement
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Void Linux, River WM and Zig
- 📫 You can reach me here at GitHub, or send an email to: henri.liukka@protonmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Follow the onion-filled story and [project log[(
https://github.com/HaLiux/HaLiux-OS-Developement-Project/blob/main/HaLiux_develog_000.log) about me as a struggling cyberspace pilot

Then a little bit more background information about myself and why I started this project.

Due to a chronical illness related health issues, I cannot practice my current profession anymore. I used to be a carpenter building and repairing wooden houses, structures and cabinets. I needed to find a way to get a flexible part-time job or earn income at home otherwise, so I decided to learn a new profession in computer sciences. So here I am, in the beginning of this personal learning journey, writing my own first ever GitHub README.md file.

As I am new to the coding world, with only some previous casual hobbyist experience and basic level Linux skills, I don't have any code or screenshots to share yet. There will be some interesting updates to this repository in the future, but until then there's only my personal project log that I can publish. It's written in a weird imaginative humorous? style to amuse myself, but also acts as a project log and notes for this serius attempt to conquer the infinite cyberhyper codespace universe...

Henkka just entered the Void.
